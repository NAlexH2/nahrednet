            <p>
              Well met! I'm <i><b>Alex Harris</b></i> and I am a senior at
              <a id="unilink" href="https://www.pdx.edu/"
                >Portland State University</a
              >
              with an expected graduation date of sometime in June 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer
              Science with the
              <a id="unilink" href="https://www.pdx.edu/engineering/"
                >Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science</a
              >, while also pursuing a minor in Mathematics.
            </p>

              When I've spoken to my friends about how we see one another, a few
              words that are frequently reoccuring descriptors have been both
              "resilient" and "soft-spoken".

          <h3>Past:</h3>
          <p id="extendedbio">
            I found that college after High School wasn't my calling. Not yet at
            least. I spent 8 years active-duty in the US Navy as an Electronics
            Technician where I worked on both internal and external means of
            communication: radios, SONAR, cryptographic equipment and a patch
            system that managed all operational calls on these systems. By the
            time my first 4 years had finished I made the enlisted rank of Petty
            Officer Second Class in a highly competitive job for the Navy.
            <br /><br />
            By the end of my second 4 years, I had worked on and managed
            multi-million dollar projects, became the ships expert on technical
            documentation, and was a highly trusted junior enlisted Sailor
            overseas in Japan. While there, I was a part of a team responsible
            for docking and undocking ships, submarines, and barges as well as
            managing helicopter flight operations.
          </p>
          <h3>Present:</h3>
          <p id="extendedbio">
            My current focus is highly on school. I returned to Portland State
            as the COVID pandemic started in the Spring of 2020. Between here
            and there I've taken classes that have taught me foundational
            programming knowledge but also algorithms and testing methodologies.
            For more on these please visit the
            <a id="unilink" href="skills.html">skills</a> page.
            <br /><br />During the Summer of 2022, I took 16 credits in order to
            finalize my graduation date and set my future up to be in a better
            position than what it would have been. Doing this was hard work and
            required a lot of dedicaiton to accomplish outstanding grades in a
            matter of eight weeks for four classes - Calculus 3, Statistics,
            Introduction to Web Development, and Advanced Programming with Java.
