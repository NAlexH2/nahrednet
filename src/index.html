                  My name is <i><b>Alex Harris</b></i> and I am a senior at
                  <a id="unilink" href="https://www.pdx.edu/"
                    >Portland State University</a
                  >
                  with an expected graduation date of June 2023.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science degree in
                  Computer Science with the
                  <a id="unilink" href="https://www.pdx.edu/engineering/"
                    >Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science</a
                  >, while also pursuing a minor in Mathematics.

                <p>
                  When I've spoken to my friends about how we see one another, a
                  few words that are frequently reoccuring descriptors have been
                  both "resilient" and "soft-spoken". Attributes that I never
                  really considered for myself, but am certainly not opposed to.
                  These haven't always been the case, but my past experience has
                  certainly helped shape me.

              <p id="extendedbio">
                I found that College after High School was not the path for me -
                not yet at least. I spent 8 years active-duty in the US Navy as
                an Electronics Technician where I worked on both internal and
                external means of communication: radios, SONAR, cryptographic
                equipment and a patch system that managed all operational calls
                on these systems. By the time my first 4 years had finished I
                made the enlisted rank of Petty Officer Second Class in a highly
                competitive job for the Navy.
                <br /><br />
                By the end of my second 4 years, I had worked on and executed
                multi-million dollar projects, became the ships expert on
                technical documentation, and was a highly trusted junior
                enlisted Sailor overseas in Japan. While there, I was a part of
                a team responsible for docking and undocking ships, submarines,
                and barges as well as managing helicopter flight operations.
              </p>

              <p id="extendedbio">
                My current focus is highly on school. I returned to Portland
                State as the COVID pandemic started in the Spring of 2020.
                Between here and there I've taken classes that have taught me
                foundational programming knowledge but also algorithms and
                testing methodologies. For more on these please visit the
                <a id="unilink" href="skills.html">skills</a> page.
                <br /><br />During the Summer of 2022, I took 16 credits in
                order to finalize my graduation date and set my future up to be
                in a better position than what it would have been. Doing this
                was hard work and required a lot of dedicaiton to accomplish
                outstanding grades in a matter of eight weeks for four classes -
                Calculus 3, Statistics, Introduction to Web Development, and
                Advanced Programming with Java.
